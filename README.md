JGBoilerplate 2: the next-generation JoomGap app template

A JoomGap starter project to create a hybrid mobile app for Joomla! CMS, powered by powered by AngularJS 2 and Ionic 2 Beta.

Includes: JoomGap Simple Library, awesome-typescript-loader, es6-promise, es6-shim, ionicons, reflect-metadata, rxjs, strip-sourcemap-loader, typescript and zone.js.

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and
combined community knowledge from open source projects. It does not impose a specific development
philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the
way that you want.
